# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Supervised-Learning-With-Deep-Neural-Network
The Agriculture Sector of almost every country, especially developing countries, is a huge part of the Countryâ€™s GDP. Annually, about 20-40% of crops worldwide are lost to pests and diseases. A major factor for this is, it is nearly impossible to keep a check on the condition of each crop, especially when the crop field spans over acres of areas. This led to the need to automate this process so that crop disease can be detected at an early stage where it can be treated properly resulting in a much lower crop yield loss.
To tackle this issue, we decided to develop and train a deep learning model to differentiate between healthy and diseases plants. Through this model we can automate the process of differentiating between healthy and diseases plants and make the process of identifying diseased plants much more efficient.
